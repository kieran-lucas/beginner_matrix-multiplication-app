## **Overview**
This is a desktop application built with PySide6 that multiplies two square matrices of order from 1 to 9.

## **Description**
When the application starts, the user is presented with an input box to enter the order (rank) of the matrices. After pressing Enter, the interface dynamically generates two input matrices of the specified size, along with a result matrix displayed on the right side.

At the bottom of the window, there are two buttons:

- Calculate – Computes and displays the result of the matrix multiplication after all inputs are provided. If any input field is left empty, its value is automatically treated as 0 during the calculation.

- Reset – Clears all input fields, allowing the user to enter new values.

The layout is designed to be simple and intuitive, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience when performing matrix multiplication
## **Install**
You can download the application directly from the link below:

After downloading, simply run the executable file to start using the application.
## **Design**
First of all, the core of this program is the multiplication of two matrices. We use the standard formula to perform the calculation. I have described this formula in more detail in the document: [Matrix Multiplication](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DHa1o-SEnARh8RUnh4cpEK9fbTWKYXSx/view?usp=sharing)

As described above, the initial interface of the program is shown below:
